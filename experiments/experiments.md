## Instructions ##

*For a selection of 5 inventor kit experiments that you choose, fill out the following sections.

### Experiment 1 ###

(saying hello to micrpo;bit)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to operate the LED screen of the micro;bit and create commands to the A and B buttons.From this i was able to connect additional buttons to the breadboard which served as a way of pressing the A and B buttons. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as light switch or train and bus signs which indicate what the next stop will be or the location users are traveling to.


### Experiment 2 ###

(using a light sensor to create night or day mode)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to operate and connect a light sensor.this involved using a resistor and small sensor which picked up on light or darkness and sent a signal back to the micro;bit. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a night time mode function on a phone, where the phone screen light dims if the environemnt light darkens also. 


### Experiment 3 ###

(changing light intensity)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to use the potentionmeter. this small elements allows for lgiht intensity of a LED to be altered. 

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as mood lighting installed in a room. also in cinemas where the lights turn off and on slowly to allow the eyes to adjust to a shift in lighting. 


### Experiment 7 ###

(creating a fan and using java script)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to type the code instead of using the blocks, as well as how to operate the small motor in the kit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a large scaled fan or a boat motor mechanism.


### Experiment 6 ###

(operating a buzzer)

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was how to make sound using the micro;bit, code and buzzer. from this pressing buttons A, B OR both created different sounds.  

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a fire alarm.
